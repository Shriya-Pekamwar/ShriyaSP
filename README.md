# Greeting, Myself Shriya ! :wave:

**ABOUT ME**

I am a graduate student currently pursuing a Master’s in Information Systems at Northeastern University, building on my foundation as a Computer Engineering graduate with a keen interest in Data Analytics, Database Design, and Intelligent Systems.

My academic journey is complemented by hands-on experience as an Application Analyst at **Deloitte**, where I honed my skills in data analysis, problem-solving, and full-stack development. This role not only deepened my technical expertise but also fueled my desire to pivot into data-driven careers and develop creative solutions. Working with cross-functional, multicultural teams in diverse settings has further enhanced my adaptability and collaboration skills.

My coursework includes**Data Modeling**, **SQL**, **Python**, and **Snowflake**, with cloud expertise across **Azure** and **AWS**. This blend of academic knowledge and practical experience has strengthened my ability to translate complex data into actionable insights and make informed recommendations.

Beyond tech, I channel my creativity through dance and yoga, which keeps me grounded and focused. I find inspiration in reading and travelling, always seeking new experiences that broaden my perspective and have cultivated resilience and perseverance.

I am excited to connect with professionals who share my passion for data, technology, and leveraging strategic data utilization to drive meaningful change. Let’s connect and collaborate to harness the power of data for impactful results!
